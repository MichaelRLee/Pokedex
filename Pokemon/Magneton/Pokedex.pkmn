Formed by several Magnemite linked together. They frequently appear when sunspots flare up.
Generates strange radio signals. It raises the temperature by 3.6F degrees within 3,300 feet.
Three Magnemite are linked by a strong magnetic force. Earaches will occur if you get too close.
The Magnemite are united by a magnetism so powerful, it dries all moisture in its vicinities.
When many Magneton gather together, the resulting magnetic storm disrupts radio waves.
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result, large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokemon.
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokemon inside a Poke Ball.
It is actually three Magnemite linked by magnetism. It generates powerful radio waves that raise temperatures by 3.6 degrees F within a 3,300-foot radius.
A linked cluster formed of several Magnemite. It discharges powerful magnetic waves at high voltage.
